But first, you need to understand what — and where — the edge is.</description></item><item><title>How Pulsar Can Help IoT Avoid the Internet - Event Streaming at the Edge</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/how-pulsar-can-help-iot-avoid-the-internet-event-streaming-at-the-edge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 15:08:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/how-pulsar-can-help-iot-avoid-the-internet-event-streaming-at-the-edge/</guid><description>This article explains how performance-sensitive IoT applications can improve their performance with event streaming at the edge using Apache Pulsar.</description></item><item><title>[Video] Using Open Source Software to improve Streaming on the Edge</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/using-open-source-software-to-improve-streaming-on-the-edge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:39:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/using-open-source-software-to-improve-streaming-on-the-edge/</guid><description>IoT devices are expected to number in the billions, each device enabled by one or more sensors, generating data about the device and its surrounding environment. Analyzing this data using machine learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, for example, frequently requires transferring this data to the cloud.</description></item></channel></rss>

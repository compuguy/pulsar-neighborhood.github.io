Online food ordering apps, e-commerce sites, media streaming services, and online gaming are straightforward examples. But weather apps, smart cars, health status apps with smartwatch technology, or anything Internet of things (IoT) typically rely on a message queue or streaming engine as well.</description></item><item><title>Pulsar: Queuing and Streaming - An All in One Messaging System</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/pulsar-queuing-and-streaming-an-all-in-one-messaging-system/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 15:03:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/pulsar-queuing-and-streaming-an-all-in-one-messaging-system/</guid><description>I would also like to focus this reading on what is Pulsar and how it works under its own merits rather than comparing it against apache Kafka. I am taking this approach as there is plenty literature doing this already and because from a messaging system architecture both of these paradigms, up to a point, are different.</description></item><item><title>Pulsar: Building a High Available Messaging System - A Step by Step CookBook</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/building-a-high-available-messaging-system-a-step-by-step-cookbook/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:36:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/building-a-high-available-messaging-system-a-step-by-step-cookbook/</guid><description>This guide will walk you step by step to deploy a Pulsar instance with one cluster but prepared already to extend the deployment further, including more Pulsar clusters at a later stage.</description></item><item><title>Getting started guides</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/guides/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:20:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/guides/getting-started/</guid><description>A collection of guides to help you get started with Pulsar</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with binaries</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/guides/getting-started/desktop/binaries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:20:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/guides/getting-started/desktop/binaries/</guid><description>This guide is for getting started using the Pulsar binaries.

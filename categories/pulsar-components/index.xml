This is possible thanks to parallel processing, wherein the data producer writes to multiple partitions and the consumer reads them.</description></item><item><title>Apache Pulsar Schema versus Schemaless — Who’s the Winner?</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-pulsar-schema-versus-schemaless-whos-the-winner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:53:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-pulsar-schema-versus-schemaless-whos-the-winner/</guid><description>In this article, we’ll examine how Pulsar Schemas work and contrast them with schemaless systems to determine the best approach. We’ll also demonstrate how to use Java clients with Pulsar.</description></item><item><title>[Video] Apache Bookkeeper and Apache Zookeeper for Apache Pulsar</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:42:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</guid><description>Enrico Olivelli speaks to the Japan Apache Pulsar User Group about how Apache Pulsar uses Apache ZooKeeper and Apache BookKeeper, with a particular focus on how Pulsar guarantees consistency even in spite of common failures in distributed systems.</description></item><item><title>[Video] Apache Pulsar Deep Dive an End-to-End View of the Data Flow</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-pulsar-deep-dive-an-end-to-end-view-of-the-data-flow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:51:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-pulsar-deep-dive-an-end-to-end-view-of-the-data-flow/</guid><description>Enrico Olivelli gives us a tour of how data moves from the Producer to the Consumer.</description></item></channel></rss>

Traditionally, organizations embraced the approach of storing and processing their data in one central location or data center, organizing this raw data based on attributes such as primary keys, IDs, types, and maximum length. While this approach was once sufficient, it doesn’t hold its own as your events move closer to the edge than your database.</description></item><item><title>The Difference Between Persistent and Non Persistent Topics in Apache Pulsar</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/the-difference-between-persistent-and-non-persistent-topics-in-apache-pulsar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 16:30:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/the-difference-between-persistent-and-non-persistent-topics-in-apache-pulsar/</guid><description>This article will explore what Pulsar topics are, the differences between persistent and non-persistent topics in Apache Pulsar, and review some example use cases for both methods.</description></item><item><title>How Pulsar and Kafka Partitions Work (And How They Differ)</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/how-pulsar-and-kafka-partitions-work-and-how-they-differ/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 15:16:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/how-pulsar-and-kafka-partitions-work-and-how-they-differ/</guid><description>Both Pulsar and Kafka aim to increase the amount of data that can be consumed and processed by horizontal scaling — spreading data across many partitions. This is possible thanks to parallel processing, wherein the data producer writes to multiple partitions and the consumer reads them.</description></item><item><title>Apache Pulsar Schema versus Schemaless — Who’s the Winner?</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-pulsar-schema-versus-schemaless-whos-the-winner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:53:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-pulsar-schema-versus-schemaless-whos-the-winner/</guid><description>In this article, we’ll examine how Pulsar Schemas work and contrast them with schemaless systems to determine the best approach. We’ll also demonstrate how to use Java clients with Pulsar.</description></item><item><title>[Video] Apache Bookkeeper and Apache Zookeeper for Apache Pulsar</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:42:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</guid><description>Enrico Olivelli speaks to the Japan Apache Pulsar User Group about how Apache Pulsar uses Apache ZooKeeper and Apache BookKeeper, with a particular focus on how Pulsar guarantees consistency even in spite of common failures in distributed systems.</description></item><item><title>[Video] Apache Pulsar Deep Dive an End-to-End View of the Data Flow</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-pulsar-deep-dive-an-end-to-end-view-of-the-data-flow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:51:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-pulsar-deep-dive-an-end-to-end-view-of-the-data-flow/</guid><description>Enrico Olivelli gives us a tour of how data moves from the Producer to the Consumer.</description></item></channel></rss>

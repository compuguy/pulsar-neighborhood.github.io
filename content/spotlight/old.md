David has been a technologist for longer than he will admit. He’s been a part of enterprise sales, developer advocacy, and open source support for years. He’s a father and a husband surrounded by horses and bourbon in Louisville, Kentucky. While he would love to share an impressive list of hobbies and leisurely activities, the truth is he’s either in dad mode or writing code. Learn more here[https://linkedin.com/in/ddieruf].

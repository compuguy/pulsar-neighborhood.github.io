Pedro is a PhD student with the Large-Scale Data & Systems (LSDS) Group at Imperial College London, where his research focuses on the interplay between Dataflow Systems and novel Deep Learning Use Cases. Pedro wrote a blog post titled "[On the Internals of Stream Processing](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pms20/post/stream-processing-thread-model/)" which was starting point for his talk at our meetup.

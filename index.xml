Transactions are an API in Apache Pulsar that enables atomic operations among pulsar consumers and producers. This talk covers the motivating factors for Transactions in a system like Apache Pulsar, deep dives into the transactions API, and walks through some examples of using Transactions with the pulsar4s client.</description><category>Pulsar architecture</category></item><item><title>[Video] Internals of Stream Processing</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.github.io/articles/internals-of-stream-processing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:36:15 -0500</pubDate><author>Apache Pulsar Neighborhood</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.github.io/articles/internals-of-stream-processing/</guid><description>
Stream Processing Systems (SPSs) are an integral part of modern data-intensive companies. In a world where streams are becoming king, they are commonly employed for much more than data analytics. Yet, most of developers only use them and have never dove deep into the internals of the system.</description><category>Pulsar architecture</category></item><item><title>Log4Shell Security Update</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.github.io/articles/log4shell-security-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 16:10:30 -0500</pubDate><author>Aaron Williams</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.github.io/articles/log4shell-security-update/</guid><description>

IoT devices are expected to number in the billions, each device enabled by one or more sensors, generating data about the device and its surrounding environment. Analyzing this data using machine learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, for example, frequently requires transferring this data to the cloud.</description><category>At the edge</category></item><item><title>[Video] Apache Bookkeeper and Apache Zookeeper for Apache Pulsar</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.github.io/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:42:47 -0500</pubDate><author>Apache Pulsar Neighborhood</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.github.io/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</guid><description>

In this article, we’ll examine how Pulsar Schemas work and contrast them with schemaless systems to determine the best approach. We’ll also demonstrate how to use Java clients with Pulsar.</description><category>Getting started</category><category>Use cases</category><category>Pulsar components</category></item><item><title>Happenings in the Pulsar Neighborhood April 22</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/happenings-in-the-pulsar-neighborhood-april-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 09:12:18 -0400</pubDate><author>Aaron Williams</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/happenings-in-the-pulsar-neighborhood-april-22/</guid><description>

Almost any application that requires real-time or near-real-time data processing benefits from having a message queue or streaming data processing component in its architecture. Online food ordering apps, e-commerce sites, media streaming services, and online gaming are straightforward examples. But weather apps, smart cars, health status apps with smartwatch technology, or anything Internet of things (IoT) typically rely on a message queue or streaming engine as well.</description><category>Getting started</category><category>Pulsar architecture</category></item><item><title>Pulsar: Queuing and Streaming - An All in One Messaging System</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/pulsar-queuing-and-streaming-an-all-in-one-messaging-system/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 15:03:42 -0400</pubDate><author>Ivan Garcia</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/pulsar-queuing-and-streaming-an-all-in-one-messaging-system/</guid><description>
I would also like to focus this reading on what is Pulsar and how it works under its own merits rather than comparing it against apache Kafka. I am taking this approach as there is plenty literature doing this already and because from a messaging system architecture both of these paradigms, up to a point, are different.</description><category>Getting started</category></item><item><title>Pulsar: Building a High Available Messaging System - A Step by Step CookBook</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/building-a-high-available-messaging-system-a-step-by-step-cookbook/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:36:23 -0400</pubDate><author>Ivan Garcia</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/building-a-high-available-messaging-system-a-step-by-step-cookbook/</guid><description>

Transactions are an API in Apache Pulsar that enables atomic operations among pulsar consumers and producers. This talk covers the motivating factors for Transactions in a system like Apache Pulsar, deep dives into the transactions API, and walks through some examples of using Transactions with the pulsar4s client.</description><category>Pulsar architecture</category></item><item><title>[Video] Internals of Stream Processing</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/internals-of-stream-processing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:36:15 -0500</pubDate><author>Apache Pulsar Neighborhood</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/internals-of-stream-processing/</guid><description>
Stream Processing Systems (SPSs) are an integral part of modern data-intensive companies. In a world where streams are becoming king, they are commonly employed for much more than data analytics. Yet, most of developers only use them and have never dove deep into the internals of the system.</description><category>Pulsar architecture</category></item><item><title>Log4Shell Security Update</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/log4shell-security-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 16:10:30 -0500</pubDate><author>Aaron Williams</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/log4shell-security-update/</guid><description>

IoT devices are expected to number in the billions, each device enabled by one or more sensors, generating data about the device and its surrounding environment. Analyzing this data using machine learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, for example, frequently requires transferring this data to the cloud.</description><category>At the edge</category></item><item><title>[Video] Apache Bookkeeper and Apache Zookeeper for Apache Pulsar</title><link>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:42:47 -0500</pubDate><author>Apache Pulsar Neighborhood</author><guid>https://pulsar-neighborhood.com/articles/apache-bookkeeper-and-apache-zookeeper-for-apache-pulsar/</guid><description>

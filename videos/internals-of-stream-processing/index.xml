Messaging is essential to modern life and how you get things done. So, without messaging, how would the world look? This question may appear far-fetched, but it’s a significant concern for computing. How do you talk to software? What is the mechanism through which software programs communicate with each other? How does software speak to you?</description><category>Getting started</category><category>Moving to pulsar</category></item><item><title>Apache BookKeeper Disk Usage With Apache Pulsar</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-bookkeeper-disk-usage-with-apache-pulsar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 16:21:04 -0400</pubDate><author>Andrey Yegorov</author><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/apache-bookkeeper-disk-usage-with-apache-pulsar/</guid><description>

This article examines how Pulsar and Kafka approach streaming by discussing their architectures and services. After briefly reviewing the definition of streaming, we’ll start our discussion with Kafka, since it’s the tool against which all others in the category are compared. We’ll then outline how Pulsar differs from and solves the problems Kafka leaves unaddressed — specifically, how it handles streaming.</description><category>Moving to pulsar</category></item><item><title>Comparing Apache Pulsar and RabbitMQ</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/comparing-apache-pulsar-and-rabbitmq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:44:53 -0400</pubDate><author>Pulsar Neighborhood</author><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/comparing-apache-pulsar-and-rabbitmq/</guid><description>

Both Pulsar and Kafka aim to increase the amount of data that can be consumed and processed by horizontal scaling — spreading data across many partitions. This is possible thanks to parallel processing, wherein the data producer writes to multiple partitions and the consumer reads them.</description><category>Pulsar architecture</category><category>Pulsar components</category></item><item><title>How Pulsar Can Help IoT Avoid the Internet - Event Streaming at the Edge</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/how-pulsar-can-help-iot-avoid-the-internet-event-streaming-at-the-edge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 15:08:31 -0400</pubDate><author>Pulsar Neighborhood</author><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/how-pulsar-can-help-iot-avoid-the-internet-event-streaming-at-the-edge/</guid><description>

Almost any application that requires real-time or near-real-time data processing benefits from having a message queue or streaming data processing component in its architecture. Online food ordering apps, e-commerce sites, media streaming services, and online gaming are straightforward examples. But weather apps, smart cars, health status apps with smartwatch technology, or anything Internet of things (IoT) typically rely on a message queue or streaming engine as well.</description><category>Getting started</category><category>Pulsar architecture</category></item><item><title>Pulsar: Queuing and Streaming - An All in One Messaging System</title><link>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/pulsar-queuing-and-streaming-an-all-in-one-messaging-system/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 15:03:42 -0400</pubDate><author>Ivan Garcia</author><guid>https://www.pulsar-neighborhood.io/articles/pulsar-queuing-and-streaming-an-all-in-one-messaging-system/</guid><description>
